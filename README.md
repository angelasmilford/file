# Overview

I want to deeply explore variables, expressions, and functions to better understand how each can enhance my projects. As a software development major, my goal is to complete my projects not only to demonstrate my skills to potential tech employers, but also to prove to myself that anything is possible when I believe in my abilities.

The file software essentially reads from or writes text to a file, demonstrating file input/output operations. 

My program performs basic file input/output operations by reading from and writing text to a file.

# Development Environment

I used a GitHub repository for version control, Visual Studio Code as my development environment, and the Rust toolchain for building the software.

Iâ€™m using Rust, a programming language known for its speed and memory efficiency.

# Future Work

- Avoid using the same variable name
- Use "println!()" for more formatting
- Add more comments on why certain steps should be done
